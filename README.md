## Description
A small personal website to showcase my work. I designed the layout using Figma. I coded the project with React, Styled Components and Flex Box.
Typefaces used are [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
Icons were generated using [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
